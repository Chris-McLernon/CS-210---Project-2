CS-210---Project-2
Chris McLernon

Brief:
  Congratulations! You have completed the interview process and have been hired as a junior developer at Chada Tech Now that you have successfully completed your 
new-hire orientation and have been introduced to the rest of your team, you are ready to jump in and start working on your first project. You are asked to collaborate 
with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Techâ€™s clients. 
  Airgead Banking is well known in the community. They often sponsor schools and have recently decided to partner 
with the local high school to develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than 
they make) via an interactive system. The initial focus for this project will be on investing and the power of compound interest. You will develop an application that 
allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functional requirements that describe what they need their 
application to do.

I feel like I tend to code fairly bug free and with enough forethought to plan ahead for issues on the users end. I care intensly about UI/UX whenever I'm dealing with it.
This program was as efficient as it needed to be and worked as intended.

Adding a file that holds the values in between accessing the banking application. This would make my code more efficient and more user friendly. A way I could make my code
more secure is by adding an exception handler to handle any issues.

The skills and resources I found most useful were: Stackoverflow is an incredible tool, first and foremost but I truly believe that one of the best resources
I've gotten better at parsing is documentation. 90% of the time your answer is in there.My ability to code multiple choice menus as well as my handle over functions 
was strengthened significantly.

By segmenting it into functions as much as needed the code can be reused quite easily. I also am a stickler when it comes to indenting and spacing out code so that is
easily digestable
